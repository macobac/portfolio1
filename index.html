                    In this project I had to make a website for a science musem called "Community Science Museum". The
                    site should attract kids ages 7-15 and their parents. The museum wants an informative and appealing
                    design without pandering the youngsters, and it should take for granted that the audience is curious
                    and intelligent.

                    In this project I was tasked with creating a blog site. I could choose my own design and topics. I
                    chose to make a website for a local non-profit cat shelter. The brief stated that the website should
                    have a headless CMS, where we had to use WordPress.
